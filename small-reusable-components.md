I'm a big fan of [node.js](http://nodejs.org). Of the many things I like about
it, my favorite is the community's focus on small, reusable components.

I can't begin to count the number of times I've been happily developing within
monolithic frameworks, and needed to do something that the framework doesn't
expose or doesn't make easy. While frameworks try to make things easier for
the programmer, they always seem to end up making things harder. Frameworks
help you as long as everything you do falls within the framework's assumptions
of what you are going to do. But so often for a project, there are
requirements that do not map exactly to something the framework does, and
you're left hacking around the framework.

On the other hand, a pervasive philosophy in node.js is that modules should be
small, do one thing, and be easy for anybody to upload. This is great; the
more focused a module is, the fewer assumptions it makes of me and my use
case. This means that I can find a handful of modules and glue them together
to get exactly what I want done, rather than compromising the product so that
it fits into the will of a monolithic framework.

The more focused a module is, the easier it is to get it to fit my exact use
case. No cruft. No struggle. Just good, readable code.
