"Build it and they will come" doesn't work on the internet. [its5.info][its5]
needed a strategy. Anything paid was out of the question: this was not a
money-making venture. Google search results for "it's 5 o'clock somewhere" are
dominated by Alan Jackson and Jimmy Buffet's hit song, so that was a no go.
But Twitter provided a world of opportunity.

I had decided early on that the project would have a Twitter account that
would surf Twitter and, like a pedantic 7-year-old, simply respond to anybody
who says "It's 5 o'clock somewhere" with information about _where_ it's 5
o'clock. This valuable public service would be performed by [@its5info][tw].

On May 14, I put the robot into action. For some reason unknown to me, I set
it to search for and reply to the phrase "its 5 oclock somewhere" without
apostrophes.

The first tweet that went out got a retweet. _This could work_, I thought.
_People might like this_, I thought. A few more tweets went out the next day.

On May 16, I realized that the bot should be searching for "it's 5 o'clock
somewhere" with apostrophes. The world would never be the same.

I flipped the switch on the search change just before 8am on the 16th.
_Editor's note: [it was 5 o'clock][8am] in Yerevan, Armenia; Muscat, Oman; and
Moscow, Russia._ Immediately, the responses started flying out. And people
seemed to like it.

Three hours – 63 tweets, 19 favorites, 9 retweets, 9 replies, and 1 invitation
for drinks – of [bringing joy to the people of the internet][joy] later, the
tweets stopped abruptly. Twitter was misinterpreting joy as SPAM, and
suspended the account.

And just like that, [@its5info][tw]'s valueable service had come to an end,
and now [its5.info][its5] is lost on the internet with no strategy to help it
find its way.

But at least [I had fun building it][why].
