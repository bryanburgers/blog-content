So, you're building a new website. And you don't want to just throw your money
away, so you'd like your shiny new website to last, what, about 5 years? That
sounds reasonable. (Most 5-year-old websites that I've seen are starting to
show their age.)

An important question for you, then, is what will the market look like between
now and five years from now? What do you need to keep in mind when you build
your new website?

Mobile.

If you're concentrating on a building the most awesome, beautiful desktop site
right now, and mobile is only a second-class consideration to you, your site
will be woefully out of date in five years. Mobile is the future.

Consider this: more and more people are buying smartphones. In fact, Horace
Deidu predicts that between 2015 and 2020, [smartphone ownership will reach
90% saturation](http://www.asymco.com/2013/10/07/when-will-the-us-reach-smartphone-saturation/),
much like the car, the radio, and the color TV (but [never the
PC](http://www.asymco.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Adoption-Rates-of-Consumer-Technologies.png)).
Couple that with the fact that, in the past 6 or 7 years, the number of
smartphones and tablets sold [has nearly caught
up](http://www.asymco.com/2013/07/18/the-pc-calamity/) with the number of PCs
*ever* sold. (Oh the last graph on that page is good.)

Pretty soon, almost everybody will have a smartphone. And typically, that
smartphone is with them at all times. Regardless of what you feel about
people's [context](http://burgers.io/1) when using that smartphone, "almost
everybody" is not a demographic you want to ignore.

If mobile is not a big part of your five-year plan, it may be time for a
rethink.
