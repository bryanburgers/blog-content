About a year ago, my wife and I had a crazy idea to write a children's book
for our daughter. Even crazier, I decided to illustrate it.

Just recently, we finally finished it and had it self-published. Enjoy the
book in its entirety below. And if you really like it, [get it on
Amazon.com][amazon] for a child in your life.

*Baby Fox Goes Camping*, by Bryan & Katie Burgers.

![Pages 2-3: Title page][02]

![Pages 4-5: Baby Fox loading the truck][04]

"Baby fox, baby fox<br>
are you ready to smile?<br>
Let's go down to the lake<br>
and go camp for a while,"<br>
<br>
Momma fox said as they<br>
packed up the truck,<br>
"We'll be camping by breakfast<br>
if we have any luck."

![Pages 6-7: Baby Fox setting up the tent][06]

They laid out the tarp<br>
and they set up the tent,<br>
the one with the poles<br>
droopy, twisted, and bent.

![Pages 8-9: Baby Fox sliding down the slide][08]

Then off to the park,<br>
it was time for a ride.<br>
He climbed up the ladder<br>
and flew down the slide.

![Pages 10-11: Baby Fox swinging on a swing][10]

While on the big swingset,<br>
he soard up so high,<br>
and a big push from daddy fox<br>
meant he could fly.

![Pages 12-13: Baby Fox building a sandcastle][12]

At the lake and the beach,<br>
there was much to explore.<br>
He ran through the waves<br>
as they splashed on the shore.

![Pages 14-15: Baby Fox and Daddy Fox riding bikes][14]

He hopped on his bike<br>
and he pedaled like mad.<br>
He was cruising so fast,<br>
spinning faster than dad.

![Pages 16-17: Baby Fox and Daddy Fox hiking][16]

It was time for adventure,<br>
so they hiked the rough trail.<br>
They saw birds, little insects,<br>
and even a snail.

![Pages 18-19: Baby Fox making a s'more][18]

Graham crackers, marshmallows,<br>
chocolate galore,<br>
and a fire for roasting,<br>
let's have a s'more.

![Pages 20-21: Baby Fox snuggling by Momma fox by the fire][20]

Baby fox sat<br>
by the warm, glowing fire<br>
but after his day<br>
he was just far too tired.<br>
<br>
Safe in mom's arms,<br>
snug in jammies and socks,<br>
what a fun trip<br>
for that young baby fox.

![Pages 22-23: Baby Fox in the tent][22]

As he laid in the tent<br>
beneath the bright moon,<br>
a sleepy fox asked,<br>
"Can we camp again soon?"
